# Q-Learning

•  Problem: Implement and evaluate a Q-Learning algorithm for a trader navigating between cities with probabilistic travel success and rewards for staying in a city.

•  Solution:

•  Part 1: Complete the graph representation of the problem, including actions and transitions.

•  Part 2: Calculate the value function ( V_{\text{stay}}(1) ) for a policy of always staying in the current city.

•  Part 3: Determine the optimal policy and value function for given parameters.

•  Part 4: Implement the Q-Learning algorithm in Python, including methods for updating Q-values and selecting actions based on exploration and exploitation strategies.

•  Part 5: Test the implementation using a gridworld environment and a robotic arm simulation, and analyze the results.
